# Sentinel — Intelligent Alert Routing & Escalation Platform

Sentinel is a backend-focused incident management platform that receives failure alerts from external systems and ensures the correct engineers are notified, escalated, and held accountable until resolution.

The system simulates real-world tools like PagerDuty by implementing routing rules, escalation policies, and notification tracking.
